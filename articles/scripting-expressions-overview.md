The `Scripting.Expressions` operators use the [expression language](https://dynamic-linq.net/expression-language) provided by the [dynamic-linq](https://dynamic-linq.net/) library.

> [!Note]
> Inside the `Expression` editor, the default expression `it` represents the value of the input node. To access a specific field in the input, reference it by name â€” for instance, `it.Item1` or `Item1`. Right-click the input node to view available fields.
